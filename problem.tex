\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:problem}
\vpara{Problem: } Motif-driven graph generation.
\vpara{Input: } The input of our problem consists of two components: the
number of vertices and edges of the network $G$, and the motif distribution 
$D$ of graph $G$, where $D$ contains only the motifs we mentioned in Figure~\ref{fig:motif}. 

\vpara{Output: } Our goal is to generate a graph $G'$ which has the same
number of vertices and edges as $G$ and a motif distribution that closely
approximates $D$.

The problem formulation is different from other graph generation problems
\cite{erdds1959random, watts1998collective, albert2002statistical,
newman2009random, molloy1995critical}, as in this paper we focus on
generating graphs based on the motif distribution.
Motif distributions are frequently used for analyzing large graphs in the
social sciences.
