\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:problem}
\vpara{Problem:} To generate a network with desired specifications.

\vpara{Input:} The input of our problem consists of is the motif 
distribution $D$. In this paper, we only consider motif within 4 vertices.

\vpara{Output:} Our goal is to generate a graph $G$ which has motif distribution that closely
approximates $D$.

The problem formulation is different from other graph generation problems
\cite{erdds1959random, watts1998collective, albert2002statistical,
newman2009random, molloy1995critical}, as in this paper we focus on
generating graphs based on the motif distribution.
Motif distributions are frequently used for analyzing large graphs in the
social sciences.
