\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:problem}
\vpara{Problem:} To generate a network with desired specifications.

\vpara{Input:} A motif distribution $D$, where each motif has at most $4$ vertices.

\vpara{Output:} A graph $G$ with a motif distribution that closely approximates $D$.

The problem formulation is different from other graph generation problems
\cite{erdds1959random, watts1998collective, albert2002statistical,
newman2009random, molloy1995critical}, as in this paper we focus on
generating graphs based on the motif distribution.
Motif distributions are frequently used for analyzing large graphs in the
social sciences.
