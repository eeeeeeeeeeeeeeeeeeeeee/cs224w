Motif counts can be used to cluster social networks. However, graph generation algorithms often focus on degree distribution instead of motif distributions. Indeed, the calculation of motif distribution in the network is a computationally expensive task. How to generate graph with existing motif distribution is very different. In this paper, we define the motif-driven graph generation problem and present a heuristic method which focus constructing the approximate motif distribution of large network. Our experiments on 9 real social network show that our approach obtains the generated graph with similar motif distribution within relevant error less then 0.02 in 10 hours.
