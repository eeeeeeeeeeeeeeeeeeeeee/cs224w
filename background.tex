In this section, we first give some basic concepts that we use throughout the paper. Then, we formulate the problem of motif-driven graph generation. 

%A \textbf{graph} is a representation of a set of objects and the
%connections between them.  It is defined as a tuple $(V, E)$, where $V$ is
%a set of $|V| = N$ vertices ("nodes") and $E \subseteq V \times V$ is a set of edges.
%The nodes in a graph correspond to the objects, and the edges to
%the connections.
%
%A graph is called \textbf{simple} if no node has an edge to itself and no two
%nodes have more than one edge between them.  A graph is \textbf{undirected}
%if whenever $(v, w)$ is an edge, $(w, v)$ is also an edge.  In our problem, 
%we assume all graphs are simple and undirected.
%
%A \textbf{subgraph} of $G$ is a graph whose nodes and edges form subsets of 
%the nodes and edges of the graph $G$.  An
%\textbf{induced subgraph} of $G$ on the vertices $V' \subseteq V$ is the
%graph consisting of the vertices $V'$ and the edges between them.

A \textbf{motif} is a small, connected graph, often considered as a
subgraph of a larger graph. In this paper, we only
consider motifs with at most $4$ vertices, which we term "1-motif", "2-motif", "3-motif" and
"4-motif" respectively. Note that a 1-motif is simply a vertex, and a 2-motif is simply an edge. A full list of motifs is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:motif}.

The \textbf{motif distribution} of a graph $G$ specifies how many of each
motif type the graph contains.  For example, the graph in Figure~\ref{fig:network} has motif
distribution \{numNodes: 25, numEdges: 44, mtThreeClosed: 21, mtThreeOpen: 151, mfFourLine: 134,
mfFourSquare: 1, mfFourStar: 305, mfFourTriangleEdge: 155, mfFourSquareDiag:
26, mfFourComplete: 2\}.  This graph contains 25 nodes, 44 edges, 21 triangles, two 4-cliques, and
so forth.
