Social motif has widely used for clustering large social network. However, graph generation algorithms often focus on degree distribution and lack of motif distribution. In this paper, we define the motif-driven graph generation problem and present a heuristic method which focus constructing the approximate motif distribution of large network. Our experiments on 67 real social network motif network distribution show that our approach obtains the generated graph with similar motif distribution within relevant error less then 0.02 in 10 hours.
