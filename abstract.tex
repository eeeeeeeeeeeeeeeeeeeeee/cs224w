Networks with similar motif distributions tend to have similar functions in the real world~\cite{chuanqi}.  In this paper, we present a heuristic method to construct graphs with specific motif distributions.  By constructing graphs with specific motif distributions, we hope to build models that will imitate the functionality of specific networks.

Our experiments on $9$ different network date sets show substantial improvement over random graphs.  On the pwr-power network\footnote{pwr-power is power grid network.}, the average relative error between the motif counts of our model and the network is $0.003$.  

%Social motif has widely used for clustering large social network. However, graph generation algorithms often focus on degree distribution and lack of motif distribution. In this paper, we define the motif-driven graph generation problem and present a heuristic method which focus constructing the approximate motif distribution of large network. Our experiments on 67 real social network motif network distribution show that our approach obtains the generated graph with similar motif distribution within relevant error less then 0.02 in 10 hours.
